🧑‍🏫 Teaching Assistant Performance Evaluation

🔧 Tools: Python, SMOTE, Scikit-learn

🧠 Model: Random Forest Classifier

🎯 Accuracy: 74%

Challenges and Risks
 - Categorical Data Transformation: Applied label encoding for the target variable and one-hot encoding for categorical features like Instructor and Course.
 - Class Imbalance: Addressed using SMOTE for oversampling and class weight adjustment during model training.
 - Multicollinearity: Managed by conducting correlation analysis and removing or combining highly correlated features.

Created a classification model to evaluate the performance of teaching assistants based on instructor feedback, class size, and course context. Addressed severe class imbalance using SMOTE and evaluated results using confusion matrix and F1-score. Project demonstrates strong use of educational data mining.
